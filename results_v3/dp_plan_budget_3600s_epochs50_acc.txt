DP details (for report):
- 0/1 knapsack DP (each candidate config can be chosen at most once).
- cost = time_per_epoch * epochs (rounded to seconds).
- value = acc_mean (or thr_mean) from runs_agg.csv.
- state: dp[t] = best total value achievable within time budget t.
- transition: dp[t] = max(dp[t], dp[t-cost_i] + value_i).
- complexity: O(N*B) with N=67 and B=3600 seconds.
